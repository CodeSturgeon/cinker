h1. General idea

Keep text files on disk synced with attrs on a couch document. The majority of the work is done by the design document, which implements update functions that provide the API. There is a small nodeJS application that uses the API to send up changes and add new files.

h1. Installing

Not much to it really, if you have node and couchdb already, your pretty much all set.

# Install couchdb + couchapp
# Install node
# Install the ddoc in your desired couch database @couchapp push ddoc mydb@

h1. Configuring

Configuration is handled by CommonJS modules specified on the command line.

Vars...
# host
# port
# db_name
# profile
# autoadd
## path
## target_attr
## pattern

Example...
<pre>

exports.profile = 'default';
exports.db_name = 'my_db';
</pre>
